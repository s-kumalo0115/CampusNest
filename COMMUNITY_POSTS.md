🚀 **Built with consistency, curiosity, and code: CampusNest is live!** 🏡🎓

Today I’m excited to share **CampusNest** — a student accommodation platform designed to make finding safe, affordable housing easier for students.

This project reminded me that coding is not just about syntax — it’s about solving real problems for real people. 💡

### 🧰 Tools I used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES Modules)
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase Storage
- Railway + Netlify
- Git + GitHub

### 🌱 What I learned
- Building role-based user flows (student/landlord/admin)
- Structuring scalable frontend modules
- Handling auth + Firestore data operations
- Shipping production-ready updates iteratively

If you’re learning to code: keep building, keep shipping, and keep improving one commit at a time. 💪
